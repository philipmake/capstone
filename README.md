A website that connects parents to suitable home tutors


Your home page structure is solid and already gives a good overview of your platform. To **spice it up** and make it more **engaging**, you can add **imagery, visuals, and interactive elements**. I'll break it down into:

---

### ‚úÖ **Suggestions to Improve Your Home Page**

#### 1. **Hero Section Upgrades**

* **Add a background image**: A warm, welcoming image of a student learning with a tutor (online or in-person).

* **Include a subheading**: Add a short phrase explaining your value proposition.
  *Example*:
  `Connecting parents with verified, top-rated tutors for personalized learning success.`

* ‚úÖ **Add an image** (stock photo or illustration) next to the headline or as background.

---

#### 2. **Feature Section Improvements**

* **Use icons or images** with each feature.
* **Differentiate features** ‚Äì right now all 3 cards say "Find experienced tutors." Change them to reflect unique features like:

  * Personalized tutor matching
  * Verified & background-checked professionals
  * Flexible scheduling options

---

#### 3. **Social Proof Section**

* **Add real names or roles** (e.g., "Parent of 5th grader")
* Use **user profile pictures** or avatars for authenticity
* Consider using a **carousel/slider** for testimonials

---

#### 4. **Add a "How It Works" Section**

Help users understand the process in 3‚Äì4 steps:

1. Sign up
2. Search or get matched
3. Connect with a tutor
4. Start learning!

Use icons or illustrations here.
